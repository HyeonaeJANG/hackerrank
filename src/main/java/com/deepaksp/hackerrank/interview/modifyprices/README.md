Complete the function so that it returns the number of incorrect sale prices recorded by Alex. It has *4* parameters.
1. <dl><dt>origItems</dt></dl> An array of Strings. where each element is an item name
2. <dl><dt>origPrices</dl></dt> An array of floating point numbers, where each element contains the original (correct) price of the item in the corresponding index of *origItems*
3. <dl><dt>items</dl></dt> An array of string containing the name of the items with sales recorded by Alex
4. <dl><dt>prices</dl></dt> An array of floating point numbers, where each element contains the sale price recorded by Alex for the item in the corresponding index of items.

**Constraints**
1. 1 <= N <= 10
2. 1 <= M <= N
3. 1.00 <= origPrices , prices <= 100000.00, where 0 <= i < N, and 0 <= j < M

**Output Format**
Return the number of items whose sale prices were incorrectly recorded by Alex.

**Sample Input 1**<br/>
String[] *origItems* = {"rice","sugar","wheat","cheese"};<br/>
float[] *origPrices* = {16.89F, 56.92F, 20.89F, 345.99F};<br/>
String[] *items* = {"rice","cheese"};<br/>
float[] *origPrices* = {15.99F, 400.79F};<br/>

**Sample Output 1**<br/>
2

**Sample Input 2**<br/>
String[] *origItems* = {"chocolate", "cheese", "tomato"}
float[] *origPrices* = {15F, 300.90F, 23.44F}
String[] *items* = {"chocolate", "cheese", "tomato"}
float[] *origPrices* = {15F, 300.90F, 10F}

**Sample Output 2**<br/>
